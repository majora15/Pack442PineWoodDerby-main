Race Rules</span></i></p>

<p ><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>THE
CAR</span></b></p>

<p ><b><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
car must be newly built for the current Cub Scouting year. </span></u></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The car should be <b><u>substantially
built by the Scout</u></b>, though parental supervision in the construction of
the car is encouraged. The car raced with at the local unit level must be the
car raced in the district race.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
body of the car must be made from the block of wood provided by the Pack, which
is in the form of an official B.S.A. Pinewood Derby Kit. <b><i>*Note: Only
B.S.A. officially licensed kits will be allowed, no unofficial Pine Car kits,
axels or wheels allowed (look for the foil BSA seal on the item).</i></b></span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623; </span><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The wheels must be placed in the slots provided</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>. If a wheel is broken
and a new slot is needed, the slot <span class=SpellE>can not</span> exceed 1/4"
of an inch from the original position (the original slots are cut at 4 1/4").</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623; </span><b><u><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Wheels may not be altered in any way</span></u></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>, except that mold
projection defects on wheel treads may be removed by sanding lightly. <b>The
wheels may not be sanded or trimmed </b>to enhance performance. The decorative
dots (the edge tread) on the wheel treads may not be removed. <b>If wheel
sanding or trimming is detected, the car will be disqualified. </b>The official
wheel width is 0.34".</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

guide strip of the <span class=GramE>track</span></span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The axles of the car must be from the official
B.S.A. Pinewood Derby Kit, as supplied by the Pack, or an official Pinewood
Derby wheel replacement kit. The wheels must be attached to the car with the
pins provided in the kit. No cars will be accepted where bearings, washers, or
spacers are used as part of the wheel assembly. The location of the axles cannot be altered or moved.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623; <b><u>You may not paint the bottom of
the car or otherwise cover the car's underside</u></b>. If you need to put a
sealant coat on the bottom of the car, it must be clear. <b>Any alterations on
the bottom of the car must be apparent upon visual inspection, and axle point
must be visible.</b></span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&#61623;
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Loose
pieces that fall off during the race are not permitted.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623; If the front of the car is designed to
gain an unfair advantage at the start or interferes with a fair start, the car
will be disqualified. No notching of front bumper allowed.The 'Front' and 'Back' of the car are
determined by the way the Scout designs the car.<a name="_Hlk117435634">However, the location
of the axles cannot be altered or moved.</a></span><span style='mso-bookmark:

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623; The total weight of the car may not
exceed 5 ounces. The maximum width of the car, including wheels, may not exceed
2.75 inches. The maximum length of the car may not exceed 7 inches. The motion
of the car may not be mechanically aided (motor, springs, C02 cartridges,
rubber bands, <span class=SpellE>etc</span>, are prohibited).</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623; All metallic attached objects that
contain <b>lead </b>must be covered with <b>clear </b>paint or fingernail
polish.</span></p>

<p  style='margin-bottom:3.55pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#61623;
Lubrication--only graphite powder or the new B.S.A. graphite lube T102/<span
class=SpellE>polytetra</span> <span class=SpellE>fluoroethlene</span> may be
used to lubricate the wheels. (Warning--other lubricants may damage the plastic
wheels and keep them from turning freely.) <b>No lubricants will be provided. </b>All
lubrication must be done over a trash can or outside before the car is
impounded. <b>Once the car is impounded, it may not be re-lubricated </b>except
when the wheel is damaged or becomes dislodged during a race.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Additional
specifics of the track can be provided upon request. Most tracks have as
standard 3-1/2&quot; wide lane width with 1/4&quot; high center guide rails,
and we will not use a non-standard track for the district races. It's
recommended that you allow at least 3/8 inch of clearance on the underside of
the car to allow it to be able to pass down the track without dragging. The
finish of the track will use a computerized mechanism, a scanner that the cars
pass through at the end of the track, which registers race finish data, and we
will use race software calculate standings for each racer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>RACE
PROCEDURE</span></b></p>

<p ><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Cars
will be raced by the Cub Scouts. </span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The pit area will be restricted to the race
participants alone, and pit access passes will be issued to each Cub Scout at
registration and impounding of the Cub Scout's race car.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>After
the Scout has registered, his car will be weighed, measured, and inspected by
the pack Pinewood Derby Pit Officials. This process will be conducted <span
class=GramE>in order to</span> ensure compliance with the racing rules.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A
digital scale will be used to weigh cars. The balance must be able to resolve
at least .1 ounce. Cars will not be accepted if their weight exceeds five (5)
ounces by even the smallest resolution of the scale.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A
Cub Scout whose car fails any part of the inspection will be given the
opportunity to <span class=GramE>make adjustments to</span> the car. Cars will
be reweighed, measured, and inspected until they comply or until the scheduled
race starting time. Any car unable to pass inspection before the start of the
race will be disqualified. <b>No exceptions.</b></span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>After
the car has passed inspection, it will be taken by an Osage District Pinewood
Derby Pit Official to the Pit Table to be impounded while the Cub Scout awaits
the start of the racing.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>When
called to race, the Scout will have three (3) minutes to report before being
disqualified. When called, the Scout will proceed to the pit area to cross the
security checkpoint and secure his car. The Scouts will then take the cars to
the Race Starter for positioning on the track. Scouts will be given time to
position themselves at the end of the track before the race begins.</span></p>


<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Upon
completion of a heat, cars must be returned to the pit area impounding table.
In the event of a breakdown of a car during the race, the participant will be
given five (5) minutes to repair the car. Only the damaged portion of the car
may be modified, and each scout is allowed only one repair. The Scout must do
work with assistance from his parent or guardian.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Pinewood
Derby Pit Officials will re-inspect any car that is serviced during the race.
The Race Officials may choose to continue with other race heats to avoid long
delays in the race schedule. The damaged car must be raced before the race
proceeds to the next level of elimination.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In the event
a scout's car jumps the track and hits another scouts car, the heat will be 
reran. However if a scout's car jumps the track and doesn't complete but doesn't
impact any other car the heat will not be reran.  That lane will be marked as 10 
seconds, race is configured to drop slowest heat.</span></p>

<p ><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
    Osage District Race is set for March 16th, <span class=GramE>2024</span></span></i></p>
